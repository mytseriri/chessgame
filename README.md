Hello ! 

This is a project I almost completed with a classmate during my first year of engineering preparatory course. It is a regular chess game.

It can be improved a lot especially on the readability of the code (esp variables) and maybe implementing dynamic programing with recursive function to replace the nested loops. Also, we need to manually write the name of the piece to move it : 
example to move the piece e3 to d4 you type (theres no display)  "e3e4". So creating a way of moving the pieces with the mouses can be implemented

There may be copy/pasted code from other similar projects and I do not remember the source of the assets which I didn't make myself. 


Thank you for reading.
